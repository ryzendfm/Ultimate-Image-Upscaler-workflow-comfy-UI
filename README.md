Hi guys, I have created an Ultimate image Upscaler Using Comfy UI, which improves the texture quality, enhances, and upscales the image 
Here I have used
dreamShaper Xl v21 turbo for Improvised Texture reconstruction and (4xRealWebPhoto_v3_atd.pth, 4k_UltraSharp) for image upscaling 
It takes around 15 minutes on my RTX 3050 with 4GB VRAM to process most of the images, but it was worth waiting, I'll show you a few of the results.
